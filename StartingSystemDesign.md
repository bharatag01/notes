Steps****
1) Functional requirement
   it covers the MVP(Minimum viable product). only cover 3-5 main features like in designing youtube most important is streaming and uploading videos.
   spent only 3-5 mins.
2)Non Functional requirement
Expectation on how those features worked.
Consistency vs availability
consistency vs latency.
3) Back of envelope calculations.
   a) Peak QPS(query per second)
   b)size of data
   c) peak network bandwidth- is sharding neeeded or read heavy/write heavy.
4) List of API
5) Architectural diagram
6) Deep dive on one -two components.
