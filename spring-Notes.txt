Spring 

Controller -means view 
spring core -core and beans,context
spring data-jdbc,orm,jms,oxm

spring container is container of beans(objects)
spring container works on factor pattern.

object---->Bean factory<----spring xml

application context when load the spring.xml it create the beans whatever defined and handover when get beans called.

bean scope

default bean scope is singleton per spring container. it is be default and it created once spring.xml loads without getbeans called.
it always return the same instane.

multipe spring cotainer can run in same jvm. so singleton scope is per conatiner.

prototype- it create when get bean called and everytime create new instance.


use application context aware-

@Autowired
it means you are injecting dependency 

1) it can be apply on above property or constructor or setter.

2) Autowiring can't be used to inject primitive and string values.

3)it means you are writing property definition in xml file which is referring to some bean.

4) first it checks by type and then by name.

@Qualifer is used with @autowired
to refer the actual bean if bean have same type or referring to same class


@Required

need to declare on setter which is required

@Component/@Service/@Controller/@Repository


1)all are similar and works with context component scan 

2)all are defined at class level

3)it means you are writing bean definition in xml file 


@Resource(name="bean name") by default go with name of variable.


@Post construct 
if you want to call anything before processing the logic then you can apply same on method

@Pre Destroy

if you want to call anything after processing the logic then you can apply same on method
