FOr submission of any problem it is running the test case and test case file size typiclaly 1 mb which store in file storage like s3.
So to solve any problem first it need to accces file storage which be in diff data center and also load the 1 mb file and then execute the 
test case so latency will be high.

so how you solve this. so the solution is using local caching but the real problem arise whne any test case is updated.
how app server knows test cases updated.

We can use versioning here and save the file like key= problemId_timestamp and value = test case and check in db if this key is present or not 
if yes then execute the test case else go to file storage and take the latest file and update the key- problemId_updatedTimeStamp and run the
test case.
