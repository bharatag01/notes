Cache size is limited
cache data might be stale/not sync with original server.

Stale data solutions
1) TTL - time to live - we can use this approach when we are ok for a particular time if data is stale.
Eg- hotstar viewer count. First time it fetch from DB and store in cache with TTL of 1 min and after that return the data.
within the next minute if any request comes so it will serve the data from cache. Here we are using global cache.
now again request comes at 69 sec so at that time it will go again to cache but ttl expired so data will be removed then again go to DB
and save in cache again.

2) Writng strategies
a) Write through cache- write the data to cache then write to DB. but write fail in DB hen remove the write from cache and update user 
write is fail but if write succed in DB then infrm the user write is pass.
con- write queries are slow. Pros- always db and cache are in sync.

b) Write back cache- first write in cache and return success to user and after that asynchronoulsy write to DB
Cons - data loss while writing to DB it fails
EG- live viewer count if supppose new user started to watch the match but write query fail so no issue.
Data loss is acceptable in situation. Pros- Write queries are Fast.

c) Write around cache-
