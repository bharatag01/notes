Suppose hou have to design live leaderboard whne contest is running.
So brute force solution- select * from from user sort by score limit 10 but in this case everytime user will hit the liveboard so it will 
hit the db. so every request hit the db.

Optimal solution- it is ok to live leaderboard little bit stale but everyone should get the same result. so will use global cache like 
redis here and write stargety will be TTL.

so in redis will store contest_id, list of users, TTL time. everytime user will hit teh request first it will hit the cache and check if 
contest id data is present or not . if yes then return it else fetch it from db save it in cache and resturn the result.
