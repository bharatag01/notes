C- Consistency
A- Availability
P-Partition Tolerance

Sometimes system is available or consistent but not both.
Partition-When software system get didvided so that both the system not able to reach each other.

CAP Theorem-The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can only provide two of three properties 
simultaneously: Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance. 

either system will be CA, CP,AP. but in distributed system there always wlll be partition so the system will never be consistent 
and available. we have to choose either consistency or availbility.

PACELC extends CAP by considering what happens when there is NO network failure or partition.
PACELC -In the case of network partitioning (P) in a distributed computer system, one has to choose between availability (A) 
and consistency (C).
But else (E), even when the system is running normally in the absence of partitions, one has to choose between latency (L) and consistency (C). 
So If there is no network partition, we have to choose between extremely low Latency or High consistency. 
They both compete with each other.  

Example- In a banking system, Consistency is important.
so we want immediate consistency
but in reality, ATM transactions (and a lot of other banking systems) use eventual consistency
In a Facebook news feed-like system, availability is more important than the consistency. 
For Quora, Availability is more important. 
For Facebook Messenger, Consistency is even more important than availability 
because miscommunication can lead to disturbance in human relations. 

Consnsiteny system is diffcult to implement in comaprsion of avalable system because we have to follow concurrrency.
Like Bank.
