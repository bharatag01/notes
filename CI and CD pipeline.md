 In a Spring Boot CI/CD pipeline, the process can be broken down like this:

✅ Continuous Integration (CI)
CI focuses on automating code integration, building, and testing.
For a Spring Boot application, CI includes:

1️⃣ Building the application (Compiling Java, resolving dependencies with Maven/Gradle).
2️⃣ Running Unit Tests (JUnit, Mockito).
3️⃣ Static Code Analysis & Security Scans (SonarQube, Checkstyle).
4️⃣ Code Quality & Linting (PMD, SpotBugs).

✅ Continuous Deployment (CD)
CD automates packaging, artifact creation, and deployment to a staging/production environment.
For Spring Boot, CD includes:

5️⃣ Packaging the Application (JAR/WAR using Maven or Gradle).
6️⃣ Deploying to a Server/Cloud (AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Tomcat, or Cloud Foundry).
7️⃣ Infrastructure as Code (IaC) (Terraform, Ansible).
8️⃣ Rolling Updates & Canary Deployments (Zero-downtime deploys using Kubernetes).


so build , unit testing , scans , code quality are CI and packaging and deployment is cd
