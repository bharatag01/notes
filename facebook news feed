News feed is supposed to show only recent posts from a friend.
You don’t expect to see a year old post in your news feed. Let’s assume you only need to show posts made in the last 30 days.

If users post frequently → Shorter TTL (e.g., 1-5 minutes).
If updates are rare → Longer TTL (e.g., 15-30 minutes).
